InfluxDB
========

This is currently a hacked up fork of Ross McDonald's role for the explicit use with the Ansible lightbulb repo's workshop solutions. This was done to avoid future unexpected breaking changes made by the underlying software that are really annoying to deal with.

An Ansible role to install, configure, and manage [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb) (a time-series database) v0.9 instances.

This role was forked from a role by [Ross McDonald](https://github.com/rossmcdonald).

Requirements
------------

Prior knowledge/experience with InfluxDB is highly recommended. Full documentation is available [here](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/introduction/overview.html).

Installation
------------

Either clone this repository, or install through Ansible Galaxy directly using the command:

```
ansible-galaxy install tima.influxdb
```

Role Variables
--------------

The high-level variables are stored in the `defaults/main.yml` file. The most important ones being:

```
# Channel of InfluxDB to install (stable, unstable, nightly)
influxdb_install_version: stable

# If multiple servers are specified, whether to create a clustered configuration
# NOTE:
#   - Do not attempt to cluster previously-unclustered servers. This can lead to data loss.
#   - This will overwrite your /etc/default/influxdb file (though it makes a backup)
influxdb_cluster_servers: no
# When clustering is enabled, whether or not to overwrite the /etc/hosts file with raw
# IPs (may be useful if no DNS resolution).
influxdb_overwrite_hosts_file: yes
```

More advanced configuration options are stored in the `defaults/main.yml` file, which includes all of the necessary bells and whistles to tweak your configuration. The entire InfluxDB configuration defaults are set using the `defaults/main.yml` file.  You may override these via inventory vars, playbook vars, or extra vars.

Dependencies
------------

No other Ansible dependencies are required. This role was tested and developed with Ansible 1.9.4.

Example Playbook
----------------

An example playbook is included in the `test.yml` file. There is also a `Vagrantfile`, which can be used for quick local testing leveraging [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
